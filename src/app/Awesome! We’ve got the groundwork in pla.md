Awesome! We’ve got the groundwork in place. Here’s where we can go next—pick any:

Build the clustering + graph-build pipeline • Show you streaming KML→Flatbush ingestion • Produce node clusters (A/B dual-entry collapse) and edges with weights

Implement the Dijkstra + node-prune approach • Code the shortest-path run for R1 • Blacklist R1’s intermediate nodes and re-run for R2

Dive into Suurballe’s algorithm for node-disjoint pairs • Walk through the directed-graph transform • Show you the two-pass Dijkstra hack and path reconstruction

Explore Yen’s k-shortest and filter for disjointness

Which one shall we tackle first? Or if you’d rather start with a high-level architecture diagram, let me know!
